* better way than solution folders/files for grouping files? show all files and no solution items perhaps?

* chrome/.net sometimes seems to get confused by asp-append-version. it doesn't seem to pick up that the file's changed and fetches the correct file, but also picks stuff up from cache. find a solution
    <script src="~/js/app.js" asp-append-version="true"></script>
    or is it an issue with the map file?

* add _viewstart to rcl?

* use partial for error pages?

* finish documenting how to use as a consumer, and how to develop

* delete old wwwroot files on install?

* use asp-append-version to simplify updating versions??

* remove scripts support from private gulpfile? 

* Use Components/, rather than scripts and styles, a la govuk?

* only run postinstall script when consumer is installing, rather than running npm install locally

If you are using Windows, you can use a different approach to achieve the same behavior. One way to do this is to use a Node.js script to check the value of the npm_config_global environment variable and run the gulp task if necessary. Here’s an example of how you can do this:

// postinstall.js
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

if (process.env.npm_config_global !== 'true') {
  spawn('gulp', ['copy-packages-js'], { stdio: 'inherit' });
}
In this example, we have created a Node.js script postinstall.js that checks the value of the npm_config_global environment variable. If the value is not "true", then the script spawns a new process to run the gulp copy-packages-js command.

You can use this script as your postinstall script by adding it to the scripts section of your package.json file:

{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "node postinstall.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "gulp": "^4.0.2"
  }
}
With this setup, when you run npm install in your package’s source code directory or when you run npm install my-package to add the package as a dependency of another package, the postinstall.js script will be run and will check whether the package is being installed globally or not. If it is not being installed globally, then the copy-packages-js gulp task will be executed.
